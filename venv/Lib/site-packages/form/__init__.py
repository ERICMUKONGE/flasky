    """Open a connection to FORM and return a link object.

    Open a connection to a new FORM process and return a
    :class:`link object <form.FormLink>`.
    The opened connection should be closed by
    :meth:`close() <form.FormLink.close>` of the returned object, which is
    automatically done by use of the "with" statement:

    >>> import form
    >>> with form.open() as formlink:
    ...     pass  # use formlink ...

    The optional argument ``args`` is for the FORM command, a string or
    a sequence of strings. For example '/path/to/form' or ['tform', '-w4'].
    By default, the value of the environment variable ``$FORM`` is used if set,
    otherwise 'form' will be used.

    The other argument ``keep_log`` indicates whether the log from FORM is kept
    and used as detailed information when an error occurs. If the value
    is >= 2, it specifies the maximum number of lines for the scrollback.
    The default value is False.

    Note
    ----
    In the current implementation, ``keep_log=True`` may cause a dead lock when
    the listing of the input is enabled and very long input is sent to FORM.
